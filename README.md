# Generalized Second Order Method For RBF Neural Networks and Center Selection From a Generated Subset Using OLS


27/12/2019 Radial Basis Function Network with Center Selection using OLS
(Orthogonal Least Squares) method. This algorithm generates centers and
widths for RBFs and then orders RBFs from highest energy to lowest. After
selecting RBFs with highest energy then it optimize weights and other
parameters using Levenberg-Marquardt Method.
